# ChuckBot!

## Thanks for checking out my bot!

> I made this bot as a for-fun project solely for the experience & practice with python. This bot is mostly useless lol. I decided to put it on github in case anyone just wants to mess with it, you will have to create your own bot to gain a token.

> I used a free API located at https://api.chucknorris.io for the jokes that ChuckBot responds with. You will not need to authenticate you requests for the bot to work.

> I used the hikari framework located at https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari with the extention library/freamework lightbulb, located at https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari for the commands.
